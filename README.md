# Luminovia Training & Consulting Website

Static bilingual website for **Luminovia Training & Consulting**, led by CEO and founder **Carina Sophie Schoppe**. The site presents bookable training, consulting, offers, former client proof, projects, pricing, credentials and contact options in German and English.

Production repository: https://github.com/Luminovia-Training-Consulting/Website.git

## Purpose

The website is designed to answer these visitor questions quickly:

- What does Luminovia Training & Consulting offer?
- Which training, consulting and project formats can be booked?
- Who is the CEO/founder and why is she credible?
- Which former client and education partner contexts support the profile?
- How can a company, academy, university or partner request a booking?

The site is static. There is no backend, no server-side rendering, no form endpoint and no production `.env` requirement.

## Core Features

- German and English language switch.
- Dark mode and light mode.
- Logo-based Luminovia visual system using navy, blue, cyan and gold.
- Static React/Vite app with React Router routes.
- GitHub Pages compatible project build under `/Website/`.
- Production build optimized through Preact compatibility mode.
- Direct contact model through email, phone and Google Calendar booking.
- Google Analytics consent banner.
- SEO metadata, canonical links, sitemap, robots file and JSON-LD structured data.
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow that builds Vite into `dist`.

## Technology

- Vite
- React API for development and tests
- Preact compatibility for production browser build
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- Vitest
- Testing Library
- jsdom
- ESLint flat config

The required Node version is declared in `package.json` as `>=24.0.0`; CI currently uses Node 26.

## Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Default local URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

Build the static site:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Test Strategy

The project has unit, integration and full-route smoke coverage.

Important test files:

| File | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `src/App.test.jsx` | Language defaults, route rendering, contact links, pricing language switch. |
| `src/pages/PagesSmoke.test.jsx` | Main static routes render in English. |
| `src/pages/FullSiteRoutes.test.jsx` | Reads `public/sitemap.xml` and renders every internal app route. |
| `src/data/trainingDetails.test.js` | Every training topic, service chip and sitemap training detail page is connected. |
| `src/data/localizationQuality.test.js` | German localization text avoids common encoding/mojibake markers. |
| `src/pages/BlogPage.test.jsx` | Blog overview, carousel controls, drag/keyboard behavior and language switch. |
| `src/pages/BlogPostPage.test.jsx` | Full article rendering, German version and unknown slug redirect. |
| `src/components/AnalyticsConsent.test.jsx` | Consent decline/accept behavior and Google tag script loading. |
| `src/components/ClientProofSection.test.jsx` | Client proof and testimonial card rendering. |
| `src/utils/browser.test.js` | Storage wrappers and stale chunk error detection. |

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The enforced coverage threshold in `vite.config.js` is:

```text
lines: 99%
```

Vitest still reports statements, branches and functions so weaker areas remain visible in CI output, but the hard quality gate is 99% line coverage across application source files.

## Full-Site Test Code

`src/pages/FullSiteRoutes.test.jsx` is the broadest route-level safety net. It:

- reads every URL from `public/sitemap.xml`,
- keeps only internal app routes,
- excludes PDF/download assets,
- renders each route through `App`,
- verifies that a `<main>` and level-one heading exist,
- fails if the rendered page or browser title is a 404,
- checks that primary navigation exposes Training, Consulting, Offers, Clients, Projects, CEO and Contact.

This test is meant to catch broken routes whenever the sitemap, router or navigation changes.

## SEO and Static Route Generation

SEO is handled in two places:

- `src/components/Seo.jsx` updates runtime metadata and JSON-LD.
- `vite.config.js` emits static `index.html` files for important routes during build.

Production builds use the Vite base path `/Website/` and the router derives its basename from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, so generated assets, public files and internal routes work on GitHub Pages project hosting.

When adding a major page, update:

1. `src/App.jsx`
2. `src/data/profile.js` if it belongs in navigation
3. `src/i18n.jsx` navigation labels
4. `src/components/Seo.jsx`
5. `vite.config.js` `prerenderRoutes`
6. `public/sitemap.xml`
7. tests, especially `FullSiteRoutes.test.jsx` if route filtering changes

## Deployment

The target remote is:

```text
https://github.com/Luminovia-Training-Consulting/Website.git
```

Deployment runs through `.github/workflows/static.yml`:

1. checkout repository,
2. setup Node.js 26,
3. `npm ci`,
4. `npm run build`,
5. upload `./dist`,
6. deploy to GitHub Pages.

CI runs through `.github/workflows/node.js.yml`:

1. `npm ci`,
2. `npm run lint --if-present`,
3. `npm run build --if-present`,
4. `npm test --if-present`.

## Assets

Luminovia logo assets:

- `public/images/luminovia-logo-full.png`
- `public/images/luminovia-logo-mark.png`

Carina profile images remain in `public/images/` and are used for the CEO/about sections.

Downloadable public assets include:

- `public/lecturer.zip`
- `public/carina-sophie-schoppe-lecturer-profile.html`
- `public/carina-sophie-schoppe-training-portfolio.html`
- `public/carina-sophie-schoppe-ai-it-training-catalogue.html`
- PDFs in `public/publications/`

## Content Maintenance

Most business content is data-driven:

- `src/data/profile.js`: company profile, contact links, image paths and navigation.
- `src/data/content.js`: English base content.
- `src/data/localizedContent.js`: German localized content and localized mappings.
- `src/data/homeContent.js`: homepage trust stats, service offerings and FAQ content.
- `src/data/trainingDetails.js`: detailed training pages and topic link mapping.
- `src/data/publications.js`: publication cards and PDF links.
- `src/i18n.jsx`: UI labels, homepage strings and contact copy.

Prefer editing these data files before hardcoding copy into components.

## Known Build Note

Vite may print this warning during build:

```text
[INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT] src/data/localizedContent.js is dynamically imported by src/components/Seo.jsx but also statically imported ...
```

The build still succeeds. The warning means the module cannot be split into a separate lazy chunk because it is also imported statically elsewhere.

## Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing changes:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
git status -sb
```

For rendered UI changes, also verify at least:

- desktop dark mode,
- desktop light mode,
- mobile dark mode,
- language switch,
- contact links,
- no horizontal overflow,
- no framework error overlay.
