Drafts became faster, summaries became cheaper and research started with a conversation instead of a blank page. Agentic AI changes the question again. Instead of asking whether a model can produce an answer, organisations now ask whether an AI system can move through a workflow: inspect context, choose tools, coordinate steps, ask for approval and leave behind an auditable result.",
                    "That sounds dramatic, but the practical version is often quite grounded. A useful agent does not need to 'run the company'. It may prepare a renewal-risk briefing, triage incoming support tickets, compare policy documents, draft a project update from live artefacts, or coordinate the boring middle of a research process. The difference is that the system is no longer just generating text. It is acting inside a bounded process.",

Agentic AI becomes valuable when it reduces handoffs, clarifies decisions and makes repeatable work more reliable.",
